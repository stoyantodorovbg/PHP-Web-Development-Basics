Homework: MySQL and PHP  Basics
This document defines the homework assignments  for "PHP Web Development Basic" Course @ Software University. Please submit ……………………………………………….???
Important! For this exercise you will need to download the ZIP file "09. PHP-MySQL-and-PHP-Exercise-Databases.zip" from the http://softuni.bg/. The file should be on the same page and section (number 20) where you downloaded this exercise (https://softuni.bg/trainings/1746/php-web-developmentbasics-september-2017#lesson-6663)
Part I. Connecting to MySQL from PHP
From PHP 7 the default module to connect to MySQL is PDO (PHP Data Objeccts) or MySQLi. First thing is you should know how to connect to your database from PHP using the MySQLi or PDO driver. In our exercise we will use PDO.
1.1.	Connecting through MySQLi
MySQLi is a class available only for MySQL which you may see in PHP code. You can connect the following way:

$db = new mysqli("127.0.0.1", "my_user", "my_password", "my_db");
// Or
$db = mysqli_connect("127.0.0.1", "my_user", "my_password", "my_db");

The function mysqli_connect() is actually an alias for the constructor of mysqli::__construct();  but it is better to use OOP. You can close the connection with 

mysqli::close($db);
//Or 
mysqli_close($db);


For more information on MySQLi visit: http://php.net/manual/en/book.mysqli.php
1.2.	Connecting through PDO
PDO is a universal driver to different databases in PHP. In our exercises we will use the PDO driver because it gives us more functionality. Visit the documentation in: http://php.net/manual/bg/ref.pdo-mysql.php. In PDO you connect like this: 

$db = new PDO("mysql:dbname=$db;host=$host", $username, $password);

Problem 1. Connect to Geography DB
Create a new project in PhpStrorm and make a new connection to your MySQL server (XAMPP or other). 
Use HeidiSQL or another tool to create a new database called geography. Import the data from the SQL file geography_database.sql which you can download from the course exercise page. See the screenshot:
 
Execute the queries (usually F9) and restart HeidiSQL. You should get something as the screenshot on the bo right.
1.1.	Connecting through MySQLi*
In your script first make a new connection using the MySQLi class by making an instance of the class. Test your connection in CLI as given in Part I.
1.2.	Connecting through PDO

Go back to PHP. Change the PHP code and connect using PDO. Test your connection in CLI:

File db_cofig.php:
<?php
$db_host     = "localhost";
$db_name     = "geography";
$db_user     = "someuser";
$db_password = "yourpass";

File geography.php:
Include("db_config.php");
$db = new PDO("mysql:dbname=$db_name;host=$host", $db_user, $db_password);


Important Note! It is important to store your database login data in a separate file, because it is specific to your server and because it contains your password. In no case should any unauthorized user be able to see it! Let the configuration file have the lowest rights possible!  
Part II. Writing MySQL Queries in PHP

Problem 2. Simple MySQL Query with PHP
We have created the connection now let's do something practical. Let's get from MySQL the names and codes of all continents. See the example below:
Example
Output
Array
(
    [continent_code] => AF 
    [0] => AF
    [continent_name] => Africa
    [1] => Africa
)

. . .  

Array
(
    [continent_code] => SA
    [0] => SA
    [continent_name] => South America
    [1] => South America
)

 To do this we will need the following code:

$continents = $db->query("SELECT * FROM `continents`");
foreach($continents as $i => $continent){
    print_r($continent);
    echo("\n\r");
}


Modify your code to show only the names of the continents!  How would the select change?
Problem 3. Wrap PDO in Your Class
To use in a more advanced way PDO it is a good idea to wrap it (extend it) in a class that we will create. We will use the previous code from Geography but we will change it. We will do this to introduce our own methods how to handle errors like this:
File geography_db.php:
<?php
$db_host     = "localhost";
$db_name     = "geography";
$db_username = "root";
$db_password = "pass4mysql";

File mypdo.php:
<?php
class MyPDO extends PDO{
    public function setErrorSilent(){
        $this->setAttribute(PDO::ATTR_ERRMODE, PDO::ERRMODE_SILENT);
    }
    public function setErrorException(){
        $this->setAttribute(PDO::ATTR_ERRMODE, PDO::ERRMODE_EXCEPTION);
    }
}

File geography.php:
<?php
include "geography_db.php";
include "mypdo.php";
try {
    $db = new MyPDO("mysql:dbname=$db_name;host=$db_host", $db_username, $db_password);
    $db->setErrorException(); // Throw exception on all errors
    $continents = $db->query("SELECT * FROM `continents`");
    foreach ($continents as $i => $continent) {
        print_r($continent);
        echo("\n\r");
    }
    $continents = null; // Close connection
    $db         = null;
} catch (PDOException $e) {
    print "PDO Error: " . $e->getMessage() . "<br/>";
}

 
Notice the change in geography.php where we can now set all errors to throw exceptions:
 $db->setErrorException();
Further we could create our own database connection method to handle tasks specific to our project. With try and catch now you can handle a specific PDOException that is thrown.
For about the PDOException handling class see: http://php.net/manual/en/class.pdoexception.php
Discussion. A very disputed question is how and where should database connection happen and how one would pass the database instance to other code. If you work in a group how would you pass $db inside a class /object hierarchy that you use? 
Problem 4. List the Continents
Create a simple PHP script using the previous code which will return a list of all continents separated by commas with their code included in brackets. Use SQL to do that.
Output
Africa (AF), Antarctica (AN), Asia (AS), Europe (EU), North America (NA), Oceania (OC), South America (SA)


Problem 5. Highly Populated Countries in Asia
Create a PHP script that will list all countries in Asia with population above 1 billion (1 000 000 000). To do that now join the two tables continents and countries.  
Output
China
India

Hint
Your query could look like this (in PhpStorm):
 
Joins will be exercised further in the course.  This is a very simple join of the tables countries and continents which uses their common field continent_code.
Problem 6. High Peaks in the Andes
A mountain climber wants to climb all peaks in the Andes mountain (id = 3) which are higher than 6700 meters. He needs to start a simple script called climb.php to do that. It uses the geography_db.sql which should be loaded in the MySQL server some way. 
Output
Aconcagua,6962
Monte Pissis,6793
Ojos del Salado,6893
Cerro Bonete,6759
Mercedario,6720
Pissis,6795


Problem 7. Call Center Application
John Dew works at a call center for a sports equipment company with international customers. For some reason he must know what is the capital of the country of his customer to be able to call one or another institution there, and give them the best offer. His customers either gives him the country name or the country code, or the ISO code of country but never three of them. John must get immediately the customer country and capital to know which offers are best for him like this: 
Input	Output
Palau
	Country: Palau
Capital: Melekeok - Palau State Capital

Cook Islands
	Country: Cook Islands
Capital: Avarua
GU
	Country: Guam
Capital: Hagatna
TLS
	Country: East Timor
Capital: Dili
Bye	Good bye!

The program must run in CLI mode all the time end exit when John writes "Bye". It uses the geography_db.sql which should be loaded in the MySQL server some way (see Problem 1)  
Important! If you use working with strings, you have to know that strings can be multi-byte. Use mb_ functions if needed. Match the encoding in PHP with that of the database!
Try to use use prepare() and execute() in the places where this is convenient. For more details on the usage visit: 
http://php.net/manual/en/mysqli.quickstart.prepared-statements.php,
http://php.net/manual/en/pdo.prepare.php, http://php.net/manual/en/pdostatement.execute.php
Hint
Where convenient use prepare/execute/fetch that could be something like this:

$stmt = $db->prepare("
  SELECT * 
    FROM `countries`
    WHERE `country_name` = ?");
if ($stmt->execute(array($input))) {
    while ($row = $stmt->fetch(PDO::FETCH_ASSOC)) {
        // Todo
    }
}

 Execute() takes as an input an array of arguments parsed into the prepare() method.
7.1.	Add Currency and Continent
Because John is not so good in remembering all, he needs also to know the local currency his customer uses and in which continent his customer is located. 
Try to write the code by using a join. Another option to create two more queries to the other two tables. 
Input	Output
KIR
	Country: Kiribati
Capital: Tarawa
Currency: Australia Dollar
Continent: Oceania

MV
	Country: Maldives
Capital: Male
Currency: Maldives (Maldive Islands) Rufiyaa
Continent: Asia
Hint
KIR is a country ISO (3 characters) and MV is a country code (2 characters). See the database through a graphical client like HeidiSQL to get oriented.
7.2.	Customers in the Mountain
A co-worker of John is called Diana. But Diana works only with customers that are in a mountain country. Now John wants to forward his calls to those customers to Diana but he must know if the country is a mountain country. If it is the application should them him. 
Input	Output
IT
	Country: Italy
Capital: Rome
Currency: Euro
Continent: Europe

Forward customer for special offers!


Hint
You should create a query to the table mountains_countries . If the country is included,  then the application should print "Forward customer for special offers!".
7.3.	Special Ski Equipment
If the country is in a region where there is a peak higher than 4000 meters Diana will offer some special equipment to those customers. You have to extend the application to check all peaks in the country and if the condition is met then it should print "Show high mountain special equipment offers!"
Input	Output
PG
	Country: Papua New Guinea
Capital: Port Moresby
Currency: Papua New Guinea Kina
Continent: Oceania

Forward customer for special offers! Show high mountain special equipment offers!


Problem 8. Call Center Application in OOP

Wrap your Call center application in a single class called CallCenter. Rewrite your code to work only with one single instance of CallCenter with the name of $app like this:

$app = new CallCenter(); // $app contains all functionality! 


Separate your project in the following files: CallCenter.php (CallCenter class), Database.php (for the Database class) and callcenter_app.php for the initial code. 

8.1. Create Database Class
Rename MyPDO from Problem 3 to Database and create a method that creates a single instance of the Database class called connect() and returns it when it is called. The Database class should check whether there is an instance and return it if it is connected. If convenient use a static variable.
Put all database configuration in your new class and use class properties instead of simple variables. Put this in a separate file Database.php
8.1. Connect to the Database in CallCenter
In your CallCenter class create a new method that connects you to the database by using the Database class. 

Problem 9. Add Customer Functionality
Write a method for CallCenter class from Problem 8 (Call Center App in OOP) which will add customer id, customer_name, customer_family and country_code in a new table called customer. Name the method addCustomer(). Use a MySQL insert statement. 
Change the input like this: (country code/name/ISO, first name, last name. See now the input/output:
Input	Output
Customer KIR, Taraba, Garabe
	Country: Kiribati
Capital: Tarawa
Currency: Australia Dollar
Continent: Oceania
Name: Taraba
Garabe: Garabe

Customer Bulgarrrria, Georgi,Ivanov	Exception: Country doesn't exist.

Do not add a new customer if he already exists! AddCustomer() should check for this. Use an SQL query to check this. If the country is not found then throw an Exception " Country doesn't exist." 

Hint
The customer table is related to countries by country_code. 


Input: Add Data
From CLI add the following customers which will be all in Bulgaria: 
Input
Customer Bulgaria, Ivan, Ivanov
Customer Bulgaria, Boyan, Stoyanov
Customer Bulgaria, Stoyan, Ganchev
Customer Bulgaria, Божидар, Божидаров

Problem 10. Delete Customer Functionality
In the call center they need now to be able to delete a customer. This is rarely done but it is needed. Especially it is needed when someone dies
Input: Delete Data
From CLI delete the following customer:
Input	Output

Remove, Stoyan, Ganchev
	
Customer Stoyan Ganchev removed.


Problem 11. Customers in Specific Country*
At the end of his working day John wants to know the names of his customers in a specific country. Create a method getCustomersInCountry( $country_name ) which prints a list of all customers in a specific country. The input and output is as follows: 
Input	Output

Customers in Bulgaria?
	
Customers in Bulgaria:
Ivan Ivanov
Boyan Stoyanov
Божидар Божидаров


Problem 12. Customers in Specific Continent**
At the end of his working day John wants to know the names of his customers in a specific continent. Create a method getCustomersInContinent( $country_name ) which prints a list of all customers in a specific continent. The input and output is as follows: 
Input	Output

Customers in continent Europe?
	
Customers in Bulgaria:
Ivan Ivanov
Boyan Stoyanov
Божидар Божидаров


Doing this for Europe should for now display all customers in Bulgaria.
Hint
You may use an SQL join because you need continents, countires and customers tables. You know the continent, you must get the countries and then the customers in the continent. Try to join three of them.
