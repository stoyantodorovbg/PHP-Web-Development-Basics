Lab: OOP Basic
This document defines the exercise assignments for the "PHP Fundamentals" Course @ Software University . 
Problem 1.	Define a class Car
Define a class Car with fields for brand, model and year. Make a three instances of the class.
Problem 2.	Add a Constructor

1.	Add constructor to the Car class from the last task

Examples
Input	Output
Nissan X-trail 2007
Renault Scenic 2001
Audi A6 2001
Renault Clio 1995	Audi,A6
Nissan,X-trail,2007
Renault,Clio,1995

Problem 5.	Add sub class
Using the previous problem, add a second class, that define car model extra details (engine, number of seats, horsepower,...). Add this information as property of main class and populate it via method. Make one instance, populate all properties and dump the object.
Problem 6.	Rewrite a code
Rewrite procedural/functional code to OOP style
<?php

function math_sum($a,$b){ 
  return $a+$b; 
} 

function math_div($a,$b){ 
  math_check_if_zero($a); 
  math_check_if_zero($b); 
  return $a / $b; 
} 

function math_check_if_zero($x){ 
  if($x == 0){ 
   echo "division by zero is not possible"; 
   exit; 
  } 
} 

echo math_sum(2,3); 
echo math_div(1,2);



Problem 7.	Create Anonymous Object
1.	Create Anonymous Object with 10 properties by your choice and populate with values
2.	Print all properties with foreach like - {name}->{value)
